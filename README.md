# JARVIS OS - AI-Native Linux Distribution

**The world's first operating system designed around AI voice interaction.**

JARVIS OS combines a custom Linux kernel with an AI voice assistant (JARVIS) as the primary interface, creating a revolutionary computing experience where users interact with their system through natural language.

## 🎯 **What is JARVIS OS?**

JARVIS OS is a custom Linux distribution where:
- **Voice is the primary interface** - Users talk to their computer instead of using mouse/keyboard
- **AI handles system administration** - JARVIS manages files, installs software, and controls the system
- **Dynamic capability discovery** - The system automatically learns new tools and capabilities
- **Privacy-first design** - All AI processing happens locally on your device

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Prerequisites**
- Linux system (Fedora/Ubuntu recommended)
- 16GB+ RAM (for building)
- 50GB+ free disk space
- Internet connection

### **Build JARVIS OS**
```bash
# 1. Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yourusername/jarvisos.git
cd jarvisos

# 2. Install build dependencies
make build-deps

# 3. Build everything
make all

# 4. Boot from ISO
# The ISO will be created at: build/iso/jarvis-os-1.0.0.iso
```

### **Development Build (Faster)**
```bash
# Just build JARVIS packages (no kernel)
make dev
```

## 🔧 **Understanding the Linux Kernel**

Since you're new to kernel development, here's what you need to know:

### **What is the Linux Kernel?**
The kernel is the core of any Linux system. It's the bridge between your hardware and software. Think of it as the "brain" that:
- Manages memory and CPU
- Handles input/output (keyboard, mouse, network, etc.)
- Manages processes and security
- Provides services to applications

### **Why a Custom Kernel for JARVIS OS?**
We're optimizing the kernel for AI workloads:
- **Real-time responsiveness** - JARVIS needs to respond quickly to voice commands
- **Audio optimization** - Better support for microphones and speakers
- **AI acceleration** - Support for GPU acceleration and specialized AI chips
- **Security hardening** - Protect AI processing from interference

### **Kernel Building Process**
1. **Configuration** - Choose which features to include
2. **Compilation** - Convert source code to machine code
3. **Installation** - Place kernel files in the right locations

## 📦 **Build System Explained**

### **Main Makefile Targets**

| Target | Purpose | Time Required |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `make setup` | Create build directories | 30 seconds |
| `make kernel` | Build custom kernel | 30-60 minutes |
| `make packages` | Build JARVIS packages | 5-10 minutes |
| `make iso` | Create bootable ISO | 2-5 minutes |
| `make all` | Build everything | 45-75 minutes |

### **Build Dependencies**
The system will automatically install:
- **Development tools** - gcc, make, etc.
- **Kernel tools** - bc, bison, flex
- **Package tools** - rpm-build, createrepo
- **ISO tools** - genisoimage, xorriso

## 🎤 **JARVIS Integration**

### **How JARVIS Works**
1. **Voice Input** - Microphone captures your speech
2. **Speech Recognition** - Whisper converts speech to text
3. **AI Processing** - LLM understands your request
4. **Tool Discovery** - SuperMCP finds the right tools
5. **Execution** - Commands are executed
6. **Voice Output** - Piper TTS responds back to you

### **System Integration**
- **Auto-start on boot** - JARVIS starts automatically
- **Systemd service** - Managed like any system service
- **Security hardening** - Runs in sandboxed environment
- **Resource management** - CPU and memory limits

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**"make: command not found"**
```bash
# Install build tools
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"  # Fedora
sudo apt-get install build-essential       # Ubuntu
```

**"No space left on device"**
```bash
# Clean build artifacts
make clean
# Or clean just kernel
cd linux && make clean
```

**"Kernel build fails"**
```bash
# Check dependencies
make build-deps
# Check kernel configuration
cd linux && make menuconfig
```

**"JARVIS won't start"**
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status jarvis
# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u jarvis -f
```

### **Getting Help**
1. Check the logs: `sudo journalctl -u jarvis -f`
2. Test components individually: `make test`
3. Verify dependencies: `make build-deps`

## 🚀 **Advanced Usage**

### **Custom Kernel Configuration**
```bash
# Edit kernel configuration
cd linux
make menuconfig

# Apply your changes
make -j$(nproc)
```

### **Adding Custom MCP Servers**
```bash
# Add to Project-JARVIS/jarvis/SuperMCP/
# JARVIS will automatically discover them
```

### **Building for Different Architectures**
```bash
# Edit Makefile
ARCH = arm64  # or x86_64
make kernel
```
